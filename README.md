# Data-Augmentation-with-DNN

The process of expanding an otherwise limited dataset in order to more efficiently train a neural network is known as Data Augmentation For images there have been used a variety of techniques, such as flipping, rotation, sub-segmenting and cropping, zooming.

# SMILES enumeration for data augmentation
Canonical SMILES is a unique way of writing a SMILES for a molecule, where some rules about numbering defines the ordering of the atoms. This ensures that there is only one unique SMILES corresponding to one unique molecule. It is often useful to have this 1:1 correspondence. However, for data augmentation purposes it is beneficial to go the other way. This way a limited size molecular dataset can be significantly expanded for extra training samples
